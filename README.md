# Using YAML multiline strings and pipes

If you're using pipes or multiline strings in your YAML inputs, check below a documentation-friendly example:

```yaml
MY_INPUT:
    description: >-
      Use a folded block scalar with chomping indicator (i.e. `>-`) when defining your multiline YAML.<br>
      Also use HTML breaking spaces as you can see at the end of each line here.<br>
      Whenever you have a pipe, please escape it with a backslash: (e.g:)`<this\|that>`.
    required: false
    default: "my_input"
```

# Local development

To develop locally, install requirements to ensure the .env file is used in the project root:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Then run the action locally:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
